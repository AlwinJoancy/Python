1. Banking System — Secure Transactions

You are building a small banking application with two classes:

BankAccount

Transaction

The BankAccount class should keep the account balance private and allow controlled access through deposit and withdraw methods.
The Transaction class handles transaction details like transaction ID, type, and amount.

Question:
How would you use encapsulation to make sure that the balance cannot be directly changed from the Transaction class or outside code, and only valid transactions can modify it?

2. Online Learning Platform

Create two classes:

Course

Student

Each Course has a course name, fee, and available seats that should not be directly changed by the student.
Each Student has a name, email, and enrollment list.

Question:
How can encapsulation be used so that a student can only enroll in a course through a method that validates fee payment and seat availability, without directly changing internal attributes?

3. Car Rental Service

Design the following classes:

Car

Rental

Customer

The Car class should protect internal data like odometer reading and availability status.
The Rental class manages the rental start and end times.
The Customer class should only be able to rent a car through defined methods, not by directly changing the car’s status.

Question:
How can encapsulation ensure that car availability is only updated by authorized operations in the Rental class?

4. E-Commerce System

You have:

Product

Inventory

Order

Product contains details like price, stock quantity, and discount, which should not be directly edited by customers.
Inventory manages product stock updates.
Order handles purchases, which should safely decrease stock.

Question:
How would you encapsulate product and inventory data to prevent unauthorized stock or price modifications while allowing Order to interact safely?

5. Hospital Management System

Classes involved:

Patient

Doctor

Appointment

Patient stores personal information and medical history (which must remain private).
Doctor can only access certain patient details.
Appointment acts as a bridge between the two.

Question:
How can encapsulation ensure that only the Doctor class (through specific methods) can view or update limited patient details, and not modify sensitive data directly?

6. Online Payment Gateway

Classes:

UserAccount

PaymentProcessor

The UserAccount class has a private balance and transaction history.
PaymentProcessor manages fund transfers between users.

Question:
How would you use encapsulation so that only the PaymentProcessor class can modify account balances safely, preventing users from changing their own balance directly?

7. Fitness Tracker Application

Classes:

User

WorkoutSession

FitnessTracker

User holds personal details and health metrics like weight and BMI, which must be updated only through authorized methods.
WorkoutSession records workouts and calories burned.
FitnessTracker calculates health statistics.

Question:
How can encapsulation ensure that health metrics cannot be directly changed by users or external classes, but can be updated through secure internal processes?

8. Library Management System

Classes:

Book

LibraryMember

LendingSystem

Book maintains details like ISBN, availability, and borrow count.
LibraryMember keeps track of borrowed books.
LendingSystem manages checkouts and returns.

Question:
How can encapsulation be used so that book availability can’t be changed directly by a member, but only through the LendingSystem?

9. Smart Home Automation

Classes:

Thermostat

Room

SmartHomeController

Thermostat holds current temperature and target settings (restricted range).
Room contains multiple thermostats.
SmartHomeController manages all devices.

Question:
How would you apply encapsulation to ensure that the thermostat temperature can’t be set to unsafe levels, and can only be adjusted through controller-approved methods?

10. Ride-Sharing Platform

Classes:

Driver

Passenger

Ride

Driver has private data like license number, rating, and earnings.
Passenger has ride history and wallet balance.
Ride handles trip requests, distance, and payments.

Question:
How can encapsulation be used to protect sensitive data like driver earnings or passenger wallet balance, ensuring they are only modified through secure ride transactions?
